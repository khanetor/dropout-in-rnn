# Dropout as Bayesian Approximation in RNN
##### Master thesis - Aalto University - Machine Learning and Data Science

## Dataset
- [Penn Tree Bank](https://www.kaggle.com/nltkdata/penn-tree-bank/data)
- Cornell film reviews: sentence polarity


## TODOs
- [x] Add biases
- [x] Make loss function
- [ ] Stack multiple LSTM layers
- [ ] Make GRU layer
- [x] Handle single dimension input
- [x] Iterate Stochastic pass once during training
- [x] Use parameter optimizer instead of writing custom loss functions
- [ ] Stack Stochastic LSTM units to 1 matrix
- [ ] Download clinical data
